                My name is Steven Koon, and this is my portal page. I have lived longer than other students, but have become a student regardless to go for my career goal as a Systems Administrator. I believe if I work hard and listen to the advice of my mentors, I will go far.

            <p>
                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has had a significant impact on my for my ability and desire to do more with my life. I become more and more converted everyday as the church focuses me more on the things that are really important in this life. The most important thing above all else is family within the kingdom of heaven, so I hope to soon grow that kingdom myself with building my own family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to engage in my hobbies of video games, music, socializing with friends, and organizational activities. I seek to apply my hobbies to being productive in my professional life.
